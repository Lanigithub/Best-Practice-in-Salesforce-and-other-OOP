### Salesforce provides a tremendous amount of declarative functionality with workflow, flow, validation rules, formulas, and more.  Knowing when to use those declarative features rather than jumping straight into an Apex or Visualforce solution separates the great developers from the rest of the pack.  This is especially important as the next few releases are bringing some amazing declarative functionality, including Process Builder.  Process Builder has the capability to declaratively build simple triggers â€“ eliminating the need to code them!
